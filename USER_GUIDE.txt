TISSUE FRAGMENT STITCHING TOOL - USER GUIDE
===========================================

QUICK START GUIDE:
------------------

1. LOADING IMAGES:
   - Click "üìÅ Load Images" or press Ctrl+O
   - Select one or more TIFF files
   - Images will appear in the fragment list and canvas

2. BASIC MANIPULATION:
   - Click on a fragment to select it
   - Drag fragments to move them
   - Use control panel buttons for rotation and flipping

3. GROUP OPERATIONS:
   - Enable "Rectangle Selection Tool" (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Drag to select multiple fragments
   - Use Group tab in control panel for group operations

4. EXPORTING:
   - Click "üíæ Export" button
   - Choose PNG for quick preview or Pyramidal TIFF for full quality
   - Select output location and settings

DETAILED FEATURES:
-----------------

FRAGMENT MANIPULATION:
- Single Fragment Controls:
  * Rotation: 90¬∞ increments or custom angles
  * Flipping: Horizontal and vertical
  * Position: Precise coordinate control
  * Visibility: Show/hide individual fragments

- Group Selection:
  * Select multiple fragments with rectangle tool
  * Rotate entire group around center point
  * Move group while preserving relative positions

LABELED POINTS:
- Add labeled points for precise alignment
- Use same labels on different fragments for correspondence
- Automatic stitching based on labeled points

RIGID STITCHING:
- Automatic feature detection and matching
- Optimizes fragment positions to minimize alignment error
- Works best with overlapping fragments

EXPORT OPTIONS:
- PNG: Fast export for presentations and previews
- Pyramidal TIFF: Multi-resolution format for analysis software
- Metadata: JSON file with all transformation parameters

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
------------------
File Operations:
- Ctrl+O: Load images
- Ctrl+E: Export image
- Ctrl+M: Export metadata
- Ctrl+Q: Quit application

Editing:
- Ctrl+Shift+R: Toggle rectangle selection
- Ctrl+R: Reset all transformations
- Delete: Remove selected fragment

View:
- Ctrl+0: Zoom to fit
- Ctrl+1: Zoom 100%
- Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
- Middle mouse + drag: Pan view

Tools:
- Ctrl+S: Rigid stitching
- Ctrl+P: Add labeled point mode
- Ctrl+Shift+S: Stitch by labels

BEST PRACTICES:
--------------

Image Preparation:
- Use preprocessed TIFF files with transparent backgrounds
- Ensure consistent resolution across fragments
- Remove artifacts and air bubbles before loading

Fragment Arrangement:
- Start with rough manual positioning
- Use labeled points for precise alignment
- Apply rigid stitching for final refinement

Performance Tips:
- Hide unused fragments to improve performance
- Use lower zoom levels for smoother interaction
- Close other applications when processing large images

Quality Control:
- Zoom in to check alignment accuracy
- Use different opacity levels to verify overlap
- Export at multiple resolutions for different uses

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------

Common Issues:
- "No fragments to export": Ensure at least one fragment is visible
- "Stitching failed": Check that fragments have overlapping regions
- Slow performance: Reduce number of visible fragments or zoom level

File Format Issues:
- Use TIFF files with proper alpha channels
- Ensure images are preprocessed and segmented
- Check that file paths don't contain special characters

Memory Issues:
- Close other applications to free RAM
- Process smaller batches of fragments
- Use lower resolution images for initial alignment

SUPPORTED WORKFLOWS:
-------------------

1. HISTOLOGY SLIDE RECONSTRUCTION:
   - Load tissue section fragments
   - Arrange using anatomical landmarks
   - Use labeled points for precise alignment
   - Export as pyramidal TIFF for analysis

2. SERIAL SECTION ALIGNMENT:
   - Load consecutive tissue sections
   - Use corresponding anatomical features
   - Apply rigid stitching for consistency
   - Export metadata for reproducibility

3. MULTI-STAIN REGISTRATION:
   - Load different staining of same tissue
   - Use tissue morphology for alignment
   - Maintain spatial relationships
   - Export for comparative analysis
