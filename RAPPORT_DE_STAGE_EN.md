## 1. INTRODUCTION

This report presents the work accomplished during my internship at the Scientific Imaging Lab, focusing on developing a professional tool for tissue fragment arrangement and rigid stitching. This desktop application, developed in Python with PyQt6, addresses the specific needs of medical imaging laboratories for reconstructing fragmented histological images.
