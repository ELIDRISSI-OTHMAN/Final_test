- Display: 1920x1080 resolution minimum

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------

Hardware:
- Processor: Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 (3.0 GHz or faster)
- Memory (RAM): 32 GB or more for large image processing
- Storage: SSD with 10 GB+ free space
- Graphics: Dedicated graphics card with 2GB+ VRAM
- Display: 2560x1440 or higher resolution

SUPPORTED IMAGE FORMATS:
-----------------------

Input Formats:
- TIFF/TIF (including pyramidal TIFF files)
- SVS (Aperio ScanScope Virtual Slide)
- PNG (for testing/preview)
- JPEG/JPG (for testing/preview)

Export Formats:
- Pyramidal TIFF (multi-resolution)
- PNG (single resolution)
- JPEG (single resolution)

NETWORK REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------
- No internet connection required for normal operation
- Internet connection recommended for:
  - Software updates
  - Documentation access
  - Technical support

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
----------------

Performance Considerations:
- Large image files (>4GB) require more RAM
- Processing speed depends on image size and complexity
- SSD storage significantly improves loading times
- Multiple CPU cores improve stitching performance

File Size Limitations:
- Maximum recommended file size per fragment: 8 GB
- Maximum recommended number of fragments: 50
- Composite output size limited by available RAM

Graphics Requirements:
- OpenGL 2.1 or higher required for UI rendering
- Hardware acceleration recommended for smooth interaction
- Some older integrated graphics may have performance issues

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------

If the application fails to start:
1. Ensure Windows 10/11 64-bit is installed
2. Update graphics drivers
3. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (latest)
4. Check Windows Event Viewer for error details

For performance issues:
1. Close other memory-intensive applications
2. Reduce number of visible fragments
3. Use lower zoom levels for better performance
4. Consider upgrading RAM for large datasets
